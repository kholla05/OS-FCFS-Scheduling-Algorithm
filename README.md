<strong>Overview of Code: </strong>
<br>
This project uses the First Come, First Serve (FCFS) CPU Scheduling Algorithm.
<br>
This program will:
<br>
- Define the process IDs, arrival times, and burst times.
- Check if the CPU is idle before the next process arrives. 
- Calculate the waiting time, response time, turnaround time, and completion time for each process.
- Calculate the averages for the waiting time, response time, and turnaround time.
- Show the results of these and the throughput to the console.
